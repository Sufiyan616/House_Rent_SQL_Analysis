OBJECTIVE
The objective of this project is to analyze house rent data using SQL to understand rental patterns across different cities and house types. The analysis focuses on comparing rents, identifying high-value and affordable locations, and deriving meaningful insights to support data-driven decisions.

TOOLS DESCRIPTION
- MySQL: Used to store and manage the house rent dataset
- SQL: Used for querying, filtering, aggregation, and analysis
- MySQL Workbench: Used to write and execute SQL queries
- GitHub: Used for version control and project sharing

ANALYSIS PERFORMED
- Calculated average rent for different house types (1 BHK, 2 BHK, etc.)
- Analyzed city-wise average rent and total rental value
- Compared 1 BHK and 2 BHK average rents across cities
- Identified houses with rent higher than the overall average
- Calculated rent per square foot for better comparison
- Ranked the top most expensive houses in each city using window functions
- Analyzed the impact of furnishing status on rent
- Classified houses into High, Medium, and Low value categories

KEY INSIGHTS
- Rental prices vary significantly from city to city
- 2 BHK houses generally have higher average rent than 1 BHK houses
- Furnished houses tend to have higher rent compared to unfurnished ones
- Some cities provide better value in terms of rent per square foot
- A small number of houses contribute most to high rental values in each city
